            Urdun is a calssic magical medieval setting. 
            It contains pastorial and fantastic regions, valient and brutal knights, powerful and terrifing gods, and mysterious and dangerous monsters.
            In order to survive the dangerous and unforgiving terrain and dangerous beasts of the world they will need to grow into valient swordfighters, powerful mages, dashing theives, and more.
            Characters can find adventure in classic monster slaying quests, palace intrigue, or even trip to unexplored continents.
        </text><IPSubTitle style='background:var(--Gray-4);'>General<f12></f12></IPSubTitle><text>
            <b>Formation:</b>
            As far as the mages of Urdun can tell, everything is created from two substances matter and ether.
            While matter functions much like it does in our world, static and physical, ether is dynamic and often harnessed for magical and spirtual abilities.
            <div style='height:2px;'></div> <b>Metaphysics:</b> 
            It is even said that souls are created by ether as well, and dissolve back it's general flow upon death.
            While most live in the physical/material world, there is said to be an ether world as well, acting somewhat as a magical shadow to the physical world.
            <div style='height:2px;'></div> <b>Gods:</b> 
            Most people of Urdun that powerful entities exist in an around Urdun called gods.
            Little is known about the nature of these entities, but they are older than recorded history and seem to be either made of or able to powerfully manipulate ether.
            Studies seem to indicate that these gods are each associated with a different states or flavors of ether.
            <div style='height:2px;'></div> <b>Doctrines:</b> 
            As ether can take on the essence of these Gods, so can souls, and Doctrines describing their worship exist.
            These Doctrines may grant great power to ther adherants, though many are forbidden among polite society.
            <div style='height:2px;'></div> <b>Magic:</b>
            There are two primary types of magic in Udrun, Arcane and Divine.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane Magic:</b> Practiced my mages, Involves manipulating ether through concentration and mastery of mathimatical and alchemic arcane formulas.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine magic:</b> Granted by the favor a god or similar divine being, in which the user channels a fraction of their power.
            <div style='height:2px;'></div> <b>Materials:</b>
            Urdun contains special materials of great value.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Gold:</b> The primary measure in value in Urdun, Gold is used as currency throughout the world.
                Lesser metals like bronze and silver are often also reffered to by their cost in gold (1/10 for bronze and 1/2 for Silver.)
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mythril:</b> The hardest known metal in Urdun. Can only be forged by highly trained smiths and using special forges.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Orichalcum:</b> A material made mostly out of inert ether, and highly valued for it's magical uses.
            <div style='height:2px;'></div> <b>Realms Beyond:</b> Little is known about exactly what lies beyond the edges of the map.

            <b>1500 Before AC (Pre-History):</b>
                Little is known of these ancient days.
                It is said Urdun was created, as well as the gods, and that there were constant wars between them, ceased only by wars against others more terrible still.
                It is also said humanoids were created at this time, though by what and why is unknown.
            <div style='height:2px;'></div> <b>-1500 to -1000AC (The Dim Ages):</b>
                Very little is known about the Dim Ages only that humanoids and the lands of Urdun had taken their shape by it's beginning.
                Tales of these times are sparse, though what exists relates to humans forming in bands and exploring their world.
            <div style='height:2px;'></div> <b>-1000AC to -500AC (The Dawn Age):</b>
                History says this was the height of human civilization.
                The Empire of the Dawn was created spanning all the lands of Urdun, and in their great sky towers powerful mages were capable of bending reality itself.
                While other humanoids thrived as well, humans themselves supposedly were able to create machines that could rival the gods.
                Many artifacts from these times can still be found in current day Urdun and are often very valuable.
                Some say it was internal strife, others say the jealousy of the gods, either way the fall occured, destroying the empire and casting Urdun into the dark ages.
            <div style='height:2px;'></div> <b>-500AC to 0AC (The Dark Age):</b>
                Also known as the The Age of Monsters, humanoids all struggled to survive as the monsterous races of Urdun rose to power.
                It is said that most cities were abandoned, technology was lost, and humans almost lost the ways of magic completely.
                In addition the alliance between the great humanoids of Humans, Elves, and Dwarves was lost as they fought each over resources.
            <div style='height:2px;'></div> <b>0AC - 300AC (The Current Age):</b>
                Various heroes throughout the world would eventually push back the monstrous armies and restablish human civilization. 
                In Arthia, the Arthurian Calandar (AC) would be established along with The Dragon Kingdom though it would splinter into wit his passing.
                Contact between continents would be reestablished, though only through distant trade routes.
                Now with the monstrous races pushing back, and most kingdoms on the brink of war, what destinys will be forged in these dangerous times.

                When Arthurus died his kingdom would slowly break apart in a series of bloody wars.
                This would eventually split into the three kingdoms of Ersonia, Venica, and Cressen.
                Cycles of war and peace would continue to the present day with no single realm able to establish a strong advantage over the others.

    <IPTitle style='background:var(--Gray-4);'>The World of Urdun</IPTitle><text>
            The greater world of Urdun is full of many different peoples and cultures. The history of these areas is less known in Arthia, but are just as storied.
            What is known by scholars is that during the Dawn Ages all these lands were unified into a single global civilization, but sense then it has fractured with many areas faling completely outside the knowledge of all but the most learned of scholars.
            Long distance trade is very dangerous yet very lucrative pursuit, so there are trade routes crossing all over Urdun though not all survive the journey.
